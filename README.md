# Complex-Networks
## Use Matlab to:
### Simulate different complex networks with different models:
 - Random networks(graph)
 - Scale-free networks
 - Small-world networks
### Estimate the robustness of these models when under random attack -- simulated by removing the nodes randomly

### Create a new network mode that has both Scale-free and Small-world networks feature
